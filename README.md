# Elevator
A digital circuit that implements elevator functionality using combinational logic, adders, encoders and decoders, as well as multiplexers and demultiplexers.

## Description
After generating a 5V power supply through a voltage regulator, a clock signal is sent to the 74LS90 using a tact switch to set the desired floor among floors 0 to 99. The selected floor is then displayed using a 7-segment display. When the toggle switch is turned ON, a clock signal is generated by the NE555 timer. This signal is used to increment the floor count from 0 using connected 74LS90 counters. The 74LS85 comparator compares the current floor with the target floor. Using logical operations through the 74LS32 and 74LS09, the system continues operating until the current floor matches the input floor.
